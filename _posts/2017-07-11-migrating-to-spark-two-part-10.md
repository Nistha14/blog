In last few blog posts we have discussed about different aspects of the migrating to spark 2.0. 
Recently I gave a talk on these topics in a our spark [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Apache-Spark-Meetup/). It was second part 
of two part series.

In this tenth blog of the series, I will be sharing recording of that talk with slides and code.
You can access all the posts in the series [here](/categories/spark-two-migration-series).
